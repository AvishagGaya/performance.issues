# Reverse Choreography Instructions | Generated Prompts for "Secondary Warrior"

## Overview
This document contains generated prompts from the Lora training, based on still photography of the "Secondary Warrior" choreography. 
These prompts are intended to reverse-engineer the choreographic scores, providing an alternate interpretation of the physical performance of the asanas.

## Purpose
The prompts serve as a foundation for AI training, aimed at creating unique choreographic interpretations based on visual inputs.
They explore the intersections of AI, choreography, and performance art.

## Contribution Guidelines
Contributors are invited to use these prompts to develop AI models or choreographic interpretations. 
We encourage adaptations, extensions, and creative explorations based on this dataset.
